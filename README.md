## Usage/installation

download the OutN bot by 
- [latest stable release](https://github.com/Pranjal-SB/OutN/releases/latest)
- [source code](https://github.com/Pranjal-SB/OutN/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

1. make a discord bot - [guide](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token#creating-a-bot) / [official page](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
2. star [this repo](https://github.com/Pranjal-SB/OutN) üòâ ~~plz~~
3. follow any of the below methods for usage


### automatic

extract the folder just run 'run.bat'

it will install dependencies and run the program by itself

for further usage i.e. not the first run and the dependencies are all already installed

you can just run 'just_run.bat' which will only run main.py and nothing else

### manual

- requires 
  - [python](https://www.python.org/) to be installed

extract the folder and open a command prompt window in it

1. install dependencies using:
  ```
  pip install aiohttp discord numpy pillow tensorflow configparser
  ```
2. then run the program using:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
>  the program will ask for your [bot token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/), [role ids](https://discordhelp.net/role-id) (for rare and regional ping) and [channel id](https://turbofuture.com/internet/Discord-Channel-ID) (for starboard, catch and spawn logger) on initialisation and then will save it to 'config.ini' so that it does not ask you every time it runs.

> [!NOTE]
> the token is only saved locally and is not sent anywhere.

> [!CAUTION]
> make sure not to upload 'config.ini' anywhere as it contains your bot token.
